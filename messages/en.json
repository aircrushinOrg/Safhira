          "q1": {
            "q": "What are STIs and how are they transmitted?",
            "a": "STIs (sexually transmitted infections) are infections that pass between people through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Some can also spread through skin-to-skin contact or sharing needles."
          },
          "q2": {
            "q": "Can I get an STI from oral sex?",
            "a": "Yes. Infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HPV can be transmitted through oral sex. Using protection (e.g., condoms or dental dams) reduces risk."
          },
          "q3": {
            "q": "Do I need testing if I have no symptoms?",
            "a": "Many STIs have no symptoms. Regular testing is recommended if you are sexually active, especially with new or multiple partners. Early detection protects you and your partners."
          },
          "q4": {
            "q": "Are STIs treatable or curable?",
            "a": "Many STIs are treatable and some (like chlamydia and gonorrhea) are curable with antibiotics. Others (like HIV and herpes) can be managed with treatment to stay healthy and reduce transmission."
          },
          "q5": {
            "q": "How can I protect myself and my partner?",
            "a": "Use condoms correctly, get tested regularly, communicate openly with partners, and avoid sex when experiencing symptoms. Vaccines (e.g., HPV, hepatitis B) also help prevent some infections."
