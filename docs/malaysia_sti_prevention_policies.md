## Executive Summary

Malaysia has developed a comprehensive framework for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention and control, centered on the National Strategic Plan for Ending AIDS 2016-2030. This policy framework encompasses eight key areas: national strategic planning, clinical guidelines, public health prevention, testing and counseling protocols, antiretroviral treatment guidelines, prevention education programs, high-risk population interventions, and legal regulatory frameworks. The overarching goal is to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets and end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

## 1. National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan

### 1.1 Malaysia's National Strategic Plan for Ending AIDS 2016-2030

The **National Strategic Plan for Ending AIDS 2016-2030** serves as Malaysia's comprehensive policy framework for HIV prevention and control[1]. This strategic plan aligns with global commitments including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets.

#### Key Objectives:
- **Primary Goal**: End AIDS as a public health threat by 2030
- **UNAIDS 95-95-95 Targets**: Achieve 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) knowing their status, 95% of diagnosed individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95% of those on ART achieving viral suppression
- **Prevention Focus**: Strengthen national efforts to prevent HIV transmission among key populations
- **Treatment Expansion**: Expand access to comprehensive HIV care and treatment services

#### Strategic Framework:
The plan adopts a **multi-sectoral approach** involving government agencies, healthcare providers, civil society organizations, and key populations. It emphasizes:

1. **Comprehensive HIV Prevention Strategy**: Integration of multiple prevention methods including condom use, harm reduction programs, treatment as prevention (TasP), and regular HIV testing
2. **Targeted Prevention**: Focus on key populations (Men who have Sex with Men - MSM, Transgender Women - TGW, People Who Inject Drugs - PWID) who face disproportionately high rates of new HIV infections
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Prevention of new infections to reduce long-term healthcare costs
4. **Enhanced Healthcare Access**: Broadening access to vulnerable populations for HIV testing, sexual health services, and harm reduction initiatives

#### Implementation Progress:
As of the mid-term review in 2022[2], Malaysia has made significant progress but faces ongoing challenges:
- **Transmission Pattern Shift**: HIV transmission has shifted from primarily injecting drug use to sexual transmission among key populations
- **Testing and Treatment Scale-up**: Notable progress in expanding HIV testing and treatment services
- **Remaining Challenges**: Reaching hidden populations and improving treatment uptake, particularly among young key populations and incarcerated individuals

## 2. STI Clinical Guidelines and Standards

### 2.1 Malaysian Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections

Malaysia's approach to STI management is governed by the **Malaysian Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections**[3], which provides standardized clinical protocols for healthcare providers nationwide.

#### Syndromic Management Approach:
The guidelines adopt the **World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed syndromic approach**, which manages STIs based on clinical presentation rather than laboratory confirmation. This approach was implemented in Malaysia in 2000 with three primary syndromes identified for primary healthcare:

1. **Urethral Discharge Syndrome**
2. **Vaginal Discharge Syndrome**
3. **Genital Ulcer Syndrome**

#### Clinical Treatment Protocols:

##### Urethral Discharge Syndrome in Men:

- **Second-line Treatment**: IM ceftriaxone 250mg single dose plus doxycycline 100mg twice daily orally for 10-14 days
- **Alternative Treatment**: IM spectinomycin 2g stat plus doxycycline 100mg twice daily orally for 10-14 days (when ceftriaxone unavailable)

##### Genital Ulcer Syndrome:
- **First-line Treatment**: IM benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units weekly for 2 consecutive weeks plus azithromycin 1.0g single oral dose
- **Penicillin Allergy**: Doxycycline 100mg twice daily orally for 14 days OR erythromycin 800mg four times daily orally for 14 days

#### Specific STI Treatment Guidelines:

##### Syphilis Management:
