## Executive Summary

This report presents Malaysia's official STI/HIV surveillance data from the Ministry of Health Malaysia, providing comprehensive epidemiological analysis covering 2020-2025. Malaysia continues to demonstrate significant progress in HIV prevention and care, with new HIV infections declining from peak rates in the early 2000s. In 2024, Malaysia reported 3,185 new HIV cases (9.4 per 100,000 population), representing a 70% reduction from 2002 levels[4]. The epidemic has undergone a fundamental transmission shift from injection drug use to sexual transmission, with men who have sex with men (MSM) emerging as the primary driver of new infections. Malaysia's progress toward the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets shows 84% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) know their status, 68% are on treatment, and 92% of those treated achieve viral suppression[1].

## 1. Introduction

Malaysia has implemented comprehensive HIV/AIDS surveillance systems through the Ministry of Health Malaysia's HIV/STI Sector, providing robust epidemiological monitoring for over 25 years. This report synthesizes official data from multiple authoritative sources including the Malaysia Global AIDS Monitoring Reports, Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) surveys, and national statistical databases to present a complete picture of the STI/HIV epidemic from 2020-2025.

## 10. Key Findings and Analysis

### 10.1 Epidemiological Transition Success

Malaysia has successfully navigated a major epidemiological transition, shifting the HIV epidemic from injection drug use to sexual transmission. This transformation required adaptive public health responses and demonstrates the country's epidemiological surveillance sophistication.

### 10.2 Key Population Health Improvements

All monitored key populations show decreasing HIV prevalence trends:
- MSM: 40% reduction (21.6% to 12.9%) from 2017-2022
- TGW: 45% reduction (10.7% to 5.9%) from 2017-2022  
- FSW: 70% reduction (6.3% to 1.9%) from 2017-2022
- PWID: Maintained at manageable levels with comprehensive harm reduction[3]

### 10.3 Prevention Program Effectiveness

Malaysia's comprehensive prevention programs demonstrate measurable impact:
- Near-universal OST coverage preventing PWID transmission
- Successful MTCT elimination achieving WHO certification
- Effective PrEP program with extremely low failure rates

### 10.4 Remaining Challenges

**Treatment Gap**: The most significant challenge is the gap between diagnosis (84%) and treatment initiation (68%), representing approximately 13,600 diagnosed but untreated individuals.

**Late Diagnosis**: With 70% of patients diagnosed at late stages, earlier testing strategies are needed.

**Structural Barriers**: Legal and social stigma continue to impede optimal prevention and care access.

## 11. Conclusion

Malaysia's HIV/STI surveillance data demonstrates substantial progress in epidemic control while highlighting areas requiring continued attention. The country has achieved remarkable success in reducing new HIV infections by 70% since peak rates, successfully transitioning harm reduction programs, and maintaining one of the world's most comprehensive surveillance systems. The shift from injection drug use to sexual transmission as the primary mode requires adaptive prevention strategies focusing on MSM and broader sexual health approaches.

Malaysia's achievements in preventing mother-to-child transmission, implementing comprehensive harm reduction, and developing robust surveillance systems provide a model for concentrated HIV epidemics globally. However, challenges remain in achieving the 95-95-95 targets, particularly in treatment initiation and addressing structural barriers that impede key population access to services.

The data presented in this report reflects Malaysia's commitment to evidence-based public health responses and transparent reporting, providing a solid foundation for continued progress toward ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.
