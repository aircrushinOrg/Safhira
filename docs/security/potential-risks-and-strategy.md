# Potential Risks and Strategy

## Potential Risks

- Insufficient Community Engagement: Lacking marketing, Lacking motivation
- Constant Data Accuracy and Maintenance: STI facts, clinic locations/hours, and map details must stay current

## Strategy

### 1. Insufficient Community Engagement

- Create Incentives for Participation: Launch gamified features such as badges, points, or leaderboards to reward contributions like reporting clinic updates, sharing educational resources, or participating in discussions.
- Partner with Local Organizations: Collaborate with clinics, universities, public health departments, and NGOs to co‑host events, Q&A sessions, and campaigns that promote the platform.
- Highlight User Contributions: Regularly feature helpful users or verified contributions in a "Community Spotlight" to foster recognition and belonging (with privacy‑first, opt‑in attribution).
- Interactive Events: Organize monthly challenges (e.g., “Myth‑busting week”, “Find your nearest testing clinic”) to keep users engaged and learning.

### 2. Lacking Marketing

- Leverage Social Media Platforms: Use Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to share digestible STI facts, clinic highlights, and anonymous success stories; link back to the map and resources.
- Utilize Influencers and Micro‑Creators: Partner with local health educators, clinicians, or student ambassadors who align with sexual health and privacy values.
- Offline Promotion at Clinics and Campuses: Place QR‑code posters/flyers in clinics, student centers, and community spaces to drive visits.
- University and School Outreach: Offer the platform as a trusted, educational companion in health courses and student wellness programs.

### 3. Lacking Motivation

- Personalized Recommendations: Suggest nearby clinics, resources, or content based on user location and browsing history (privacy‑respecting and opt‑in).
- Growth Tracking Feature: Let users track their learning journey (e.g., topics read, clinics bookmarked, reminders set) to build a sense of progress.
- Social Interaction Tools: Enable likes, comments, and anonymous support in forums or Q&A while enforcing strong moderation and stigma‑aware guidelines.
- Push Notifications: Send friendly, optional nudges (e.g., reminders for regular testing, myth‑busting tips) to re‑engage inactive users.

### 4. Constant Data Accuracy and Maintenance

- Crowdsourced Updates with Moderation: Allow users to suggest edits for clinic details and resources, with a moderation workflow or expert review for quality assurance.
- Integration with Official Data Sources: Sync with government, clinic networks, or NGO datasets to keep clinic hours, services, and locations up‑to‑date.
- Monthly Data Review Cycles: Establish routine review and verification of high‑impact data (clinics, key STI facts, high‑traffic pages) with clear ownership.
- AI‑Assisted Validation: Use ML/AI tools to assist with categorizing resources and detecting outdated or conflicting information for human review.
