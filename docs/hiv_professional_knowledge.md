## 1. HIV Virus Structure and Biological Characteristics

### 1.1 Viral Classification and Morphology

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) belongs to the family Retroviridae, subfamily Lentiviridae, genus Lentivirus[50]. The virus exhibits a characteristic spherical morphology with a diameter of 100 to 120 nanometers. The mature virion contains a cone-shaped fullerene capsid core composed of approximately 1,500 Capsid (CA; p24) proteins arranged in hexameric and pentameric structures[50].

The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane, incorporating both host proteins (major histocompatibility molecules, CD44, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) and essential viral glycoproteins. Two primary envelope glycoproteins facilitate viral entry: gp120 (surface glycoprotein) arranged as a trimer and gp41 (transmembrane glycoprotein), which anchors the glycoprotein complex to the virion surface[50].

### 1.2 Genome Organization and Genetic Elements

HIV possesses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 9.2 kilobases, demonstrating remarkable genetic efficiency through overlapping gene-coding regions that utilize all three reading frames[50]. The viral genome encodes nine genes broadly classified into structural, catalytic, regulatory, and accessory categories.

**Structural Genes:**
- **gag**: Encodes the Gag polyprotein (approximately 2,400 copies per immature virion), which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce Matrix (MA/p17), Capsid (CA/p24), Nucleocapsid (NC/p7), and p6 proteins[50]
- **env**: Encodes envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 essential for viral entry[50]
- **pol**: Encodes enzymatic proteins including Reverse Transcriptase (RT), Integrase (IN), and Protease (PR)[50]

**Regulatory Genes:**
- **tat**: Encodes Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat/p14), essential for viral replication[50]
- **rev**: Encodes Regulator of Virion protein expression (Rev/p19), controlling post-transcriptional regulation[50]

**Accessory Genes:**
- **nef**: Encodes Negative Regulatory Factor (Nef/p27), enhancing infectivity and immune evasion[50]
- **vpr**: Encodes Viral Protein R (Vpr/p15), facilitating nuclear transport and cell cycle arrest[50]
- **vpu**: Encodes Viral Protein U (Vpu/p16), enhancing viral release and CD4 degradation[50]
- **vif**: Encodes Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif/p23), counteracting APOBEC3 antiviral proteins[50]

### 1.3 Viral Proteins and Functions

**Matrix Protein (MA/p17):** Functions in targeting virion assembly through binding to phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate domains at the plasma membrane, facilitating gp41 binding for envelope incorporation, and associating with the inner membrane of mature virions[50].

**Capsid Protein (CA/p24):** Forms the viral core through hexameric and pentameric structures, mediates Gag oligomerization during assembly, and constitutes the protective capsid housing the viral RNA genome[50].

**Nucleocapsid Protein (NC/p7):** Binds viral RNA for genome packaging, mediates Gag assembly processes, and remains associated with viral RNA within the mature capsid core[50].

**Envelope Glycoproteins:** The gp120 surface protein exhibits extensive variability with exposed variable regions (V regions) facing the neutralizing antibody response, while constant regions remain buried within the trimeric structure. The protein undergoes extensive glycosylation, with over half its molecular weight attributed to complex and high-mannose N-linked glycans that create a "silent face" protecting against antibody responses[50].

### 1.4 Viral Life Cycle Components

The HIV replication cycle involves several critical enzymatic processes mediated by virally encoded proteins. Reverse Transcriptase (RT) converts viral single-stranded RNA into linear double-stranded DNA through RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Integrase (IN) facilitates insertion of viral DNA into the host genome and participates in dynein-mediated transport of the reverse transcription complex. Protease (PR) performs essential cleavage of Gag-Pol polyproteins during viral maturation[50].

Non-coding regulatory elements include the Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequences essential for reverse transcription, integration, and transcriptional regulation, and the Rev responsive element located within the gp41 coding region that interacts with Rev protein to facilitate nuclear export of unspliced viral transcripts[50].

## 2. Pathophysiology and Immune Mechanisms

### 2.1 CD4+ T Cell Targeting and Depletion

The hallmark of HIV pathogenesis involves the selective infection and progressive depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to profound immunodeficiency[*extracted from PMC source*]. Under normal conditions, the adult human body contains approximately 22 × 10^11 CD4+ T cells, with this population becoming significantly compromised during HIV infection. When peripheral blood CD4+ T cell counts decline to 200 cells per microliter, the total CD4+ T cell population is effectively halved[*extracted from PMC source*].

### 2.2 Mechanisms of CD4+ T Cell Depletion

**Direct Viral Cytopathic Effects:** HIV directly infects CD4+ T cells through binding to the CD4 receptor and coreceptors (CCR5 or CXCR4), leading to productive infection that results in cell lysis or syncytia formation. During acute HIV-1 infection, approximately 1 billion viral particles are produced daily, creating an enormous burden of infected cells[*extracted from PMC source*].

**Chronic Immune Activation:** The "hyper immune activation hypothesis" describes elevated rates of cellular division among CD4+, CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells, accompanied by upregulation of activation markers. Remarkably, the level of immune activation serves as a better predictor of disease progression than viral load itself. Activated CD4+ T cells exhibit shortened lifespans and undergo activation-induced cell death through apoptotic pathways[*extracted from PMC source*].

**Pyroptosis-Mediated Cell Death:** Recent research reveals that 95% of CD4+ T cell depletion occurs through caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis in quiescent lymphoid CD4+ T cells that become abortively infected. Only 5% of CD4+ T cell loss results from classical apoptosis in permissively infected cells. Pyroptosis represents a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that creates a vicious cycle, with dying cells releasing inflammatory signals that perpetuate immune activation[*extracted from PMC source*].

### 2.3 Immune System Dysfunction

HIV infection triggers a cascade of immune dysfunction characterized by lymphopenia, diminished lymphocyte proliferative responses, and inversion of the helper T cell to cytotoxic T cell ratio. The immune system becomes hyperactive with elevated T cell turnover, nonspecific T cell activation and proliferation, polyclonal B cell activation, and sustained elevation of proinflammatory cytokines[*extracted from PMC source*].

**Cytokine Storm and Inflammation:** HIV infection induces massive release of proinflammatory cytokines including Type I interferons, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-8, interleukin-1α, interleukin-1β, macrophage inflammatory proteins, RANTES, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Elevated plasma proteins include neopterin, β2-microglobulin, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and interferon-inducible protein-10[*extracted from PMC source*].

**Mucosal Immune Dysfunction:** HIV preferentially targets and depletes CD4+ T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, leading to selective loss of Th17 cells crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. This dysfunction facilitates microbial translocation, particularly lipopolysaccharides from the gastrointestinal tract, which further stimulates toll-like receptors and perpetuates chronic immune activation[*extracted from PMC source*].

### 2.4 HIV-1 versus HIV-2 Pathogenesis

HIV-2 demonstrates significantly attenuated pathogenesis compared to HIV-1, characterized by slower CD4+ T cell decline, lower viral loads, longer clinical latency periods, and better preserved T cell immunity. HIV-2 infection shows relative expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), particularly memory-activated phenotype cells lacking CD45RA expression. The majority of Tregs in HIV-2 infection express FoxP3 and produce interleukin-2, contrasting with HIV-1 where this pattern is not observed[*extracted from PMC source*].

The median time to AIDS development varies dramatically between virus types: HIV-1 progression ranges from months to years with an estimated median of 9.8 years, while HIV-2 progression spans 10-25 years, with 86-95% of HIV-2-infected individuals classified as long-term nonprogressors[*extracted from PMC source*].

## 3. Transmission Routes and Epidemiology

### 3.1 Primary Transmission Routes

HIV transmission occurs through three principal mechanisms: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding[53]. The virus spreads through exchange of specific body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions[53].

### 3.2 Sexual Transmission

Sexual transmission represents the predominant mode of HIV acquisition globally, with transmission risk varying significantly based on the type of sexual activity, viral load of the infected partner, and presence of co-infections. Anal or vaginal sex without condoms presents substantial transmission risk, with receptive anal intercourse carrying the highest per-act transmission probability[53].

**Risk Enhancement Factors:**
- Presence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and bacterial vaginosis[53]
- Harmful alcohol or drug use in sexual contexts[53]
- Lack of male circumcision (for receptive partners)[53]

### 3.3 Blood-Borne Transmission

Blood-borne transmission occurs through sharing contaminated needles, syringes, and other injection equipment, or drug solutions during injecting drug use. Healthcare-related transmission can result from receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, or medical procedures involving unsterile cutting or piercing. Occupational exposure among healthcare workers through accidental needle stick injuries represents another transmission route[53].

### 3.4 Mother-to-Child Transmission

Perinatal HIV transmission from mother to child can occur during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding. Without preventive interventions, transmission risk ranges from 25-30%[*medical literature reference*]. However, with effective antiretroviral therapy and appropriate interventions, transmission risk can be reduced to less than 1-2%[58].

### 3.5 Global Epidemiology (2024 Data)

According to the latest WHO statistics, approximately 40.8 million people were living with HIV globally at the end of 2024, with an estimated 1.3 million new infections occurring during the year, including 120,000 children. HIV-related deaths totaled approximately 630,000 globally in 2024. About 31.6 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in 2024, an increase from 30.3 million in 2023[46].

The WHO African Region bears approximately 65% of the global HIV burden, highlighting persistent geographic disparities in HIV prevalence and access to care[46].

### 3.6 Prevention of Transmission

**U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable):** People living with HIV who achieve and maintain undetectable viral loads through consistent antiretroviral therapy do not transmit HIV to sexual partners[53]. This principle, supported by extensive clinical evidence, represents a paradigm shift in HIV prevention messaging and has significant implications for reducing HIV-related stigma.

**Biomedical Prevention:** Core prevention strategies include consistent male or female condom use during sexual activity, regular HIV and STI testing, male circumcision for HIV-negative men, harm reduction services for people who inject drugs, and access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)[53].

## 4. HIV Testing Methods and Diagnostics

### 4.1 Testing Algorithm and Approach

HIV testing utilizes a sequential approach beginning with initial screening tests followed by confirmatory testing when positive results are obtained[52]. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 13-64 years receive HIV testing at least once, with more frequent testing (at least annually) for individuals with increased risk factors[52].

### 4.2 HIV Testing Technologies

**Antibody Tests:** These tests detect antibodies produced by the immune system in response to HIV infection. Available sample types include blood drawn from veins, oral fluid, and finger stick blood samples. Blood drawn from veins can detect HIV sooner than finger stick or oral fluid samples. Most rapid tests and FDA-approved self-tests are antibody-based[52].

**Antigen/Antibody Tests:** These combination tests detect both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen, which is produced before antibodies develop. The recommended laboratory test uses blood drawn from a vein, though rapid antigen/antibody finger stick tests are available. These tests can identify infection earlier than antibody-only tests[52].

**Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** NAT directly detects the actual virus (HIV RNA) in blood and represents the earliest detectable marker of infection. NAT is used for individuals with recent exposure, possible exposure symptoms, early infection symptoms, or negative antibody/antigen test results. NAT can also determine viral load, providing quantitative measurement of virus present[52].

### 4.3 Window Periods and Detection Timing

The window period varies significantly based on testing technology:

- **Antibody Tests:** 23-90 days after exposure
- **Rapid Antigen/Antibody Test (finger stick):** 18-90 days after exposure  
- **Antigen/Antibody Lab Test (blood from vein):** 18-45 days after exposure
- **Nucleic Acid Test (NAT):** 10-33 days after exposure[52]

### 4.4 Test Results and Interpretation

**Rapid Tests:** Provide results within 30 minutes or less using oral fluid or finger stick blood samples[52].

**Self-Tests:** Deliver results within 20 minutes using oral fluid or blood, performed privately at home with results interpreted according to manufacturer instructions[52].

**Laboratory Tests:** Require several days for results but offer the advantage of automatic confirmatory testing on the same sample if initial results are positive[52].

### 4.5 Confirmatory Testing

Positive antibody test results require confirmatory testing to establish a definitive diagnosis. Laboratory-based tests automatically perform follow-up testing on the same sample, while positive results from community programs or self-tests necessitate follow-up with healthcare providers for confirmatory testing[52].

### 4.6 Special Testing Considerations

**Pregnancy:** All pregnant individuals should receive HIV testing during each pregnancy, with testing repeated at or around 28 weeks gestation (conjunction with syphilis testing) and/or at delivery hospitalization admission[58].

**Post-Exposure Testing:** Individuals receiving post-exposure prophylaxis require testing at 4-6 weeks and 12 weeks after exposure to confirm the absence of HIV infection[55].

## 5. Treatment Protocols and Antiretroviral Therapy

### 5.1 2024 Treatment Principles

The 2024 IAS-USA guidelines emphasize that antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, ideally within 7 days and optimally on the same day or first clinic visit if the patient is ready and there is no suspicion of concomitant opportunistic infections[54]. This approach maximizes the clinical benefits of early treatment while minimizing the risk of disease progression.

### 5.2 First-Line Treatment Regimens

**Recommended Initial Regimens for Most Adults and Adolescents:**

1. **Bictegravir/Tenofovir Alafenamide/Emtricitabine (BIC/TAF/FTC)** - Single tablet regimen providing high efficacy with excellent tolerability (AIa evidence rating)[54]

2. **Dolutegravir plus Tenofovir/Emtricitabine or Lamivudine (DTG + TXF/XTC)** - Highly effective combination with high barrier to resistance (AIa evidence rating)[54]

3. **Dolutegravir/Lamivudine (DTG/3TC)** - Two-drug regimen suitable for specific conditions: HIV RNA <500,000 copies/mL, no lamivudine resistance, no hepatitis B coinfection, limited data for CD4+ <200/μL. Not recommended for rapid ART initiation when genotype, HIV RNA, and hepatitis B serology results are unavailable (AIa evidence rating)[54]

**Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTI) Advantages:** Current INSTI-based regimens (bictegravir, dolutegravir) offer high rates of viral suppression, excellent tolerability, infrequent toxicity, limited drug-drug interactions, high genetic barrier to resistance, and low pill burden[54].

### 5.3 Special Population Considerations

**Pregnancy:** The preferred regimen is tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine or lamivudine plus dolutegravir (AIa evidence rating). Alternative regimens include tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or lamivudine plus dolutegravir if tenofovir alafenamide is unavailable, or ritonavir-boosted darunavir combinations in specific circumstances[54]. Notably, bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine is now a preferred ART regimen for HIV during pregnancy and when trying to conceive[58].

**Previous PrEP Exposure:** Individuals who acquired HIV while receiving tenofovir-based PrEP should undergo genotyping before initiating therapy, with a three-drug regimen (preferably dolutegravir or bictegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine or lamivudine) recommended if ART is started before genotype results are available[54].

**Cabotegravir PrEP Exposure:** For individuals who acquired HIV after cabotegravir PrEP exposure, integrase genotyping should be performed before initiating INSTI-based regimens. If therapy is desired before genotype results or if INSTI resistance is suspected, ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted darunavir with tenofovir/emtricitabine or lamivudine should be used[54].

### 5.4 Treatment During Tuberculosis Coinfection

For individuals with latent or active tuberculosis requiring rifamycin-containing regimens, recommended options include tenofovir/emtricitabine or lamivudine with dolutegravir (50 mg twice daily during active tuberculosis treatment with rifamycin-containing regimens) or efavirenz (600 mg). Alternative regimens include ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor combinations with rifabutin substituted for rifampin[54].

### 5.5 Injectable Long-Acting Therapy

**Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine Long-Acting:** This injectable combination, administered every two months, is recommended for individuals with viral suppression who prefer not to take daily oral medications or face adherence challenges. The regimen is not recommended for individuals with documented or suspected resistance to either component or those with chronic hepatitis B[54].

### 5.6 Treatment Monitoring and Response

**Virologic Success:** ART aims to achieve and maintain HIV RNA levels below detectable limits (<50 copies/mL). HIV RNA testing should be performed 4-6 weeks after ART initiation, then every 3 months until suppression is achieved, followed by monitoring every 6 months[54].

**Immunologic Recovery:** CD4+ cell counts should be monitored every 6 months until levels exceed 250/μL for one year, after which monitoring can be discontinued unless virologic failure or immunosuppressive conditions develop[54].

---

## 6. Prevention Strategies

### 6.1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)

The 2024 IAS-USA guidelines recommend offering PrEP to all sexually active individuals, anyone requesting it, and those using nonprescription drugs or substances, without requiring specific risk criteria assessment[54]. This universal approach recognizes that traditional risk assessment may inadequately capture individual transmission risk.

### 6.2 Daily Oral PrEP Regimens

**Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC):** Recommended for all populations likely to be exposed to HIV (AIa evidence rating). The regimen should be initiated with a double dose, then continued as a single daily tablet. For rectal exposures, continue until 2 doses after last sexual activity; for vaginal/neovaginal exposures, continue for 7 days after last sexual activity. This remains the recommended oral regimen during pregnancy and breastfeeding[54].

**Tenofovir Alafenamide/Emtricitabine (TAF/FTC):** Limited to cisgender men and others whose exposures do not include receptive vaginal sex (including neovaginal sex) or injection drug use alone. Specifically recommended for individuals with creatinine clearance 30-60 mL/min and those with known osteopenia or osteoporosis. Bone density scans are not necessary before initiating TAF-based PrEP[54].

### 6.3 On-Demand PrEP (2+1+1 Regimen)

The on-demand TDF/FTC regimen is recommended for cisgender men and others planning receptive anal sex (not vaginal/neovaginal exposures). Dosing involves a double dose 2-24 hours before sexual activity, followed by single doses at 24 and 48 hours after the first dose. For individuals on hormone therapy, administration with food is recommended. This approach has insufficient data for injection drug use or vaginal exposures[54].

### 6.4 Long-Acting Injectable PrEP

**Cabotegravir Long-Acting:** Recommended for people likely to be exposed to HIV sexually and for people who inject drugs at sexual risk. The regimen involves 600 mg (3 mL) gluteal injections, with the first two injections administered 4 weeks apart, followed by every 8-week dosing. An oral lead-in period is optional, recommended for individuals with severe atopic histories or upon patient request, but not recommended for those who struggle with daily oral dosing[54].

**Lenacapavir (Future Approval):** Currently in clinical trials with expected approval, lenacapavir is recommended for prevention of HIV infection for all routes of sexual exposure when available. The regimen involves twice-yearly subcutaneous injections, with the first injection overlapped with 2 daily oral doses (600 mg each). Clinical trials demonstrated exceptional efficacy, with the PURPOSE 1 study showing no detected HIV infections among cisgender women in Southern and Eastern Africa, and the PURPOSE 2 study showing only 2 incident infections representing a 96% reduction in HIV acquisition[54].

WHO approved lenacapavir (branded as Yeztugo) in July 2025 as the first FDA-approved HIV prevention option offering 6 months of protection with just two injections per year[46,56].

### 6.5 Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)

The 2025 CDC guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations for nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis following potential HIV exposure[55].

**Indications:** PEP is recommended when exposure occurred within 72 hours and presents substantial risk for HIV transmission, with the source having HIV without sustained viral suppression or unknown viral suppression status[55].

**Timing:** Initiate PEP as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours but no later than 72 hours after exposure. The initial dose should not be delayed pending laboratory results[55].

### 6.6 2025 PEP Regimens

**Preferred Regimens for Adults and Adolescents ≥12 years:**
- Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (single tablet)
- Dolutegravir plus (tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus (emtricitabine or lamivudine)[55]

**Alternative Regimens:**
- Boosted protease inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted darunavir plus tenofovir plus emtricitabine/lamivudine[55]

**Special Populations:** Specific regimens are recommended for pregnant women, children of various age groups, and individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, with detailed protocols provided for each population[55].

### 6.7 Behavioral and Structural Interventions

**Comprehensive Prevention:** Effective HIV prevention requires combination approaches including biomedical interventions (PrEP, PEP, treatment as prevention), behavioral interventions (condom use, risk reduction counseling), and structural interventions (addressing stigma, improving healthcare access, harm reduction programs)[53].

**Harm Reduction:** For people who inject drugs, comprehensive harm reduction services include access to sterile injection equipment, opioid substitution therapy, naloxone distribution, safe injection education, and referral to treatment services[54].

## 7. Opportunistic Infections

### 7.1 Definition and Pathophysiology

Opportunistic infections (OIs) are infections that occur more frequently or with greater severity in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV, compared to individuals with healthy immune systems[51]. These infections are caused by various pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites that can be transmitted through multiple routes including air, body fluids, contaminated food, and contaminated water[51].

### 7.2 AIDS-Defining Conditions

Many opportunistic infections, along with certain cancers, are classified as AIDS-defining conditions. These represent life-threatening infections that occur when HIV has progressively destroyed the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Examples of common OIs include candidiasis, Salmonella infections, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and pneumonia[51].

### 7.3 Risk Factors and Prevention

The primary protection against opportunistic infections for people with HIV is maintaining consistent adherence to prescribed HIV medicines, which prevents further immune system damage[51]. OIs have become significantly less common among people with HIV in the United States compared to previous years due to widespread use of effective HIV medications. However, they remain a significant concern for individuals who are undiagnosed, not receiving treatment, or whose HIV medicines are not adequately controlling their infection[51].

### 7.4 Prevention Strategies

**Primary Prevention:**
- Adherence to antiretroviral therapy to maintain immune function
- Avoidance of known sources of infection
- Safe food and water practices
- Use of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections
- Avoiding sharing of injection equipment[51]

**Secondary Prevention (Prophylaxis):**
- Specific antimicrobial prophylaxis for high-risk patients based on CD4+ cell counts
- Vaccination when appropriate and safe
- Regular monitoring and screening for early detection[51]

### 7.5 Management Principles

**Treatment Approach:** The specific medicine used for OI treatment depends on the causative organism. Available treatment categories include antiviral drugs, antibiotic drugs, antifungal drugs, and antiparasitic drugs[51].

**Healthcare Provider Considerations:** Providers must consider multiple factors when prescribing OI treatments, including the patient's current HIV medications, existing medical conditions (such as diabetes or kidney disease), and potential drug interactions. OI medications are generally more effective when patients maintain good control of their HIV through adherence to their antiretroviral regimen[51].

**Post-Treatment Care:** After successful treatment of an opportunistic infection, patients may need to continue the same medicine or switch to another agent to prevent recurrence of the infection[51].

### 7.6 Common Opportunistic Infections

Based on the 2025 NIH guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV, key OIs include:

**Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP):** Prophylaxis recommended for patients with CD4+ counts <200 cells/μL
**Toxoplasmosis:** Prophylaxis indicated for patients with CD4+ counts <100 cells/μL who are toxoplasma-seropositive
**Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC):** Prophylaxis for patients with CD4+ counts <50 cells/μL
**Cryptococcal Disease:** Screening with cryptococcal antigen recommended for patients with CD4+ counts <100 cells/μL[51]

### 7.7 Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)

IRIS represents a paradoxical worsening of opportunistic infections or appearance of new infections following initiation of antiretroviral therapy, particularly in patients with very low CD4+ cell counts. This phenomenon results from restoration of inflammatory responses as the immune system recovers, requiring careful clinical monitoring and sometimes anti-inflammatory treatment.

## 8. Special Populations

### 8.1 HIV During Pregnancy

The 2025 perinatal HIV guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations for managing HIV during pregnancy, with significant updates to treatment protocols and prevention strategies[58].

**Preferred ART Regimens During Pregnancy:**
- Bictegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide plus emtricitabine (BIC/TAF/FTC) is now a preferred regimen during pregnancy and when trying to conceive
- Dolutegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine/lamivudine remains highly effective[58]

**Key Principles:**
- ART should not be avoided or withheld before conception or in early pregnancy to prevent preterm birth
- ART should not be avoided or withheld if hypertensive disorders of pregnancy develop
- Enhanced antenatal surveillance of fetal growth in the third trimester may be considered for individuals on boosted protease inhibitor regimens due to increased risk of low birth weight/small-for-gestational-age infants[58]

### 8.2 Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Repeat HIV testing at or around 28 weeks gestation (in conjunction with syphilis testing) and/or at time of delivery hospitalization admission[58]

**Delivery Recommendations:**
- If HIV RNA is >1,000 copies/mL or unknown near birth, scheduled cesarean delivery at 38 weeks gestation is recommended to minimize transmission risk
- Individualized birth plans remain possible with expert consultation
- Fetal scalp electrodes should be avoided when viral suppression is achieved and should not be used when viral suppression is not achieved (≥50 copies/mL)[58]

**Infant Management:**
- Risk-stratified approach based on maternal viral load:
  - **High-risk infants** (exposed to viremia ≥50 copies/mL in 4 weeks prior to delivery): 3-drug ARV regimen for 2-6 weeks
  - **Low-risk infants** (exposed to HIV RNA <50 copies/mL from 20 weeks gestation through delivery): zidovudine alone for 2 weeks[58]

### 8.3 Pediatric HIV Management

**Treatment Principles:**
- Early initiation of ART is crucial for optimal outcomes in children
- Age-appropriate formulations and dosing are essential
- Growth and development monitoring require specialized expertise
- Transition planning for adolescents moving to adult care[58]

**Special Considerations:**
- Disclosure challenges require age-appropriate counseling approaches
- Adherence strategies must account for developmental stages
- Drug resistance patterns may differ from adult populations

### 8.4 HIV-2 Infection

**Clinical Characteristics:**
- HIV-2 demonstrates slower disease progression compared to HIV-1
- Lower viral loads and longer clinical latency periods
- Different drug resistance profiles require modified treatment approaches[58]

**Treatment Recommendations:**
- Align with Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for monitoring treatment response
- Acknowledge lack of validated genotypic/phenotypic resistance assays
- For pregnant individuals with HIV-2, infant ARV management should follow HIV-1 guidelines using drugs active against HIV-2
- Nevirapine should not be used for HIV-2 exposure[58]

### 8.5 Substance Use Disorders

**Integrated Care Approach:**
- Screening, diagnosis, and treatment for substance use disorders should be provided to all persons at risk for and with HIV
- SUD treatment should be integrated into HIV prevention and treatment services
- Rapid HIV testing and linkage to immediate ART or PrEP provision is recommended[54]

**Harm Reduction Services:**
- Offer naloxone distribution and training
- Provide safe injection education and sterile injection equipment
- Distribute fentanyl/xylazine test strips
- Facilitate referral to syringe service programs and safe injection sites[54]

**PrEP for People Who Use Drugs:**
- Offer oral PrEP (TDF/FTC or TAF/FTC) or injectable long-acting cabotegravir for sexual risk
- Provide oral TDF/FTC for injection drug use risk
- Integrate with comprehensive addiction treatment services[54]

## 9. Drug Resistance and Management

### 9.1 HIV Drug Resistance Overview

HIV drug resistance represents a significant clinical challenge that has evolved with the expansion of antiretroviral therapy access globally. According to the WHO 2024 HIV drug resistance report, resistance patterns have become increasingly complex, particularly in the era of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)[57].

### 9.2 Dolutegravir Resistance Patterns

**Emergence and Prevalence:**
Dolutegravir (DTG) resistance has emerged at higher rates than initially anticipated, especially among individuals with extensive prior treatment experience. Despite DTG's high effectiveness (>90% sustained viral suppression with adherent use), resistance has been documented in multiple settings[57].

**Prevalence Data:**
- Up to 4.8% prevalence in published cohorts among individuals without viral suppression
- US PEPFAR studies in 4 low- and middle-income countries found 3.9% DTG resistance among people on ART for at least 9 months without viral suppression
- Among individuals with heavy prior treatment experience, DTG resistance reached 19.6%[57]

**Pretreatment Resistance:**
Eleven countries reported pretreatment DTG resistance data to WHO, with one country documenting 0.2% prevalence of rare non-polymorphic integrase mutations. These surveys were conducted before or early in DTG introduction[57].

### 9.3 PrEP-Associated Resistance

**Tenofovir/Lamivudine Resistance:**
PrEP-associated drug resistance remains relatively low for individuals acquiring HIV while appropriately using tenofovir-containing PrEP. However, resistance rates increase dramatically (>10-fold) when PrEP is initiated during undiagnosed acute HIV infection[57].

**Recent Surveillance Data (2020-2023):**
- 310 reported seroconversions among individuals on oral tenofovir PrEP
- 20% of these cases had tenofovir or lamivudine resistance
- Risk significantly higher if PrEP initiated during undiagnosed infection[57]

**Long-Acting Cabotegravir PrEP:**
Ten cases of integrase inhibitor drug resistance have been reported among individuals using long-acting cabotegravir PrEP, with all cases demonstrating mutations conferring cross-resistance to dolutegravir[57].

### 9.4 Rilpivirine Resistance

Pretreatment rilpivirine (RPV) resistance varies significantly by geographic region, ranging from 0.0% (95% CI 0.0-9.4%) in Tajikistan (2016) to 16.6% (95% CI 11.2-24.0%) in Eswatini among individuals initiating ART without previous antiretroviral exposure[57].

### 9.5 Management Strategies

**Prevention Approaches:**
- Ensure availability of optimal antiretroviral medicines
- Maintain patients in care with emphasis on treatment adherence
- Increase access to and utilization of viral load testing
- Implement rapid regimen switching in confirmed treatment failure cases
- Provide effective management of high viral loads in pregnant and breastfeeding women[57]

**Testing Recommendations:**
The 2024 IAS-USA guidelines specify when drug resistance testing should be performed:
- At HIV diagnosis and before starting ART: reverse transcriptase-protease genotype (AIIa evidence)
- INSTI resistance testing: not routinely recommended unless there is cabotegravir-PrEP exposure or partner has INSTI-resistant virus
- At virologic failure: HIV RNA reverse transcriptase-protease genotype; INSTI genotype if on INSTI-based regimen[54]

### 9.6 Treatment of Drug Resistance

**Novel Mechanism Agents:**
For individuals with multiclass resistance including INSTI resistance, agents with novel mechanisms of action are recommended, ideally in combination:
- Ibalizumab (post-attachment inhibitor)
- Fostemsavir (attachment inhibitor)  
- Lenacapavir (capsid inhibitor)[54]

**Salvage Therapy Principles:**
- Continue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) due to partial antiviral activity
- Utilize drugs with different resistance profiles
- Consider long-acting injectable regimens for adherence challenges
- Monitor closely for treatment response and toxicity[54]

## 10. Clinical Monitoring and Laboratory Parameters

### 10.1 Baseline Assessment

**At HIV Diagnosis and ART Initiation:**
- HIV RNA level and CD4+ cell count (AIIa evidence rating)
- General health assessment including lipid levels, kidney and liver function, complete blood count, glucose, and pregnancy status (AIa evidence rating)
- ART resistance testing (reverse transcriptase-protease genotype) (AIIa evidence rating)
- Screening for potential coinfections including hepatitis A/B/C, latent tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections (AIIa evidence rating)[54]

**Special Populations:**
- Cryptococcal antigen testing for patients with CD4+ cell counts <100/μL (AIa evidence rating)
- INSTI resistance testing if cabotegravir-PrEP exposure or partner has INSTI-resistant virus (BIII evidence rating)[54]

### 10.2 Monitoring During ART

**Virologic Monitoring:**
- HIV RNA testing at 4-6 weeks after ART initiation
- Every 3 months until viral suppression is achieved
- Every 6 months once suppression is maintained[54]

**Immunologic Monitoring:**
- CD4+ cell count every 6 months until levels exceed 250/μL for 1 year
- Monitoring can be discontinued unless virologic failure or immunosuppressive conditions develop
- Resume monitoring if treatment changes or complications arise[54]

**Clinical Monitoring:**
- Assessment for medication toxicity and tolerability
- General health evaluation including age and risk-appropriate cancer screening
- Vaccination status and administration of recommended immunizations
- STI screening based on risk factors and clinical concerns[54]

### 10.3 Long-Term Monitoring

**Stable Patients (>1 year suppressed, clinically stable, adherent):**
- Safety laboratories and HIV RNA every 6 months (AIa evidence rating)
- For patients suppressed >5 years who prefer less frequent monitoring: annual testing (BIII evidence rating)[54]

**Specialized Monitoring:**
- Renal function monitoring for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: baseline and yearly urine glucose and protein levels (BIII evidence rating)
- Bone density assessment for patients with risk factors for osteoporosis
- Cardiovascular risk assessment including blood pressure and lipid monitoring[54]

### 10.4 Monitoring at Virologic Failure

**Initial Assessment:**
- Repeat HIV RNA measurement in 2-4 weeks if levels >50 copies/mL
- Assess medication adherence and tolerability (AIa evidence rating)[54]

**Resistance Testing:**
- HIV RNA reverse transcriptase-protease genotype if HIV RNA >200 copies/mL on 2 consecutive measurements
- INSTI genotype assay if patient is on INSTI-based regimen (AIII evidence rating)[54]

**Additional Testing:**
- Viral tropism testing before maraviroc use; avoid if X4 or dual-tropic virus detected (AIa evidence rating)
- HLA-B*5701 testing before abacavir use; avoid if present (AIa evidence rating)[54]

### 10.5 Special Monitoring Considerations

**Weight and Metabolic Monitoring:**
- Document weight and BMI at baseline and every 6 months for INSTI- or tenofovir alafenamide-based regimen initiators/switchers
- Emphasize lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise) for weight management
- GLP-1 receptor agonists show similar efficacy to general population[54]

**Cardiovascular Risk Management:**
- Monitor blood pressure at each clinical visit
- Statin therapy recommendations based on ASCVD risk stratification
- Consider switching from abacavir-containing regimens for patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease[54]

## 11. Future Directions and Emerging Therapies

### 11.1 Long-Acting Injectable Therapies

**Lenacapavir for Treatment and Prevention:**
Lenacapavir represents a breakthrough in HIV prevention with its twice-yearly dosing schedule. FDA approval in June 2025 as Yeztugo for HIV prevention marked a significant milestone, offering 6 months of protection with just two injections annually[46,56]. Clinical trials demonstrate exceptional efficacy, with near-complete prevention of HIV acquisition in high-risk populations[54].

**Expanding Long-Acting Options:**
Research continues on additional long-acting formulations for both treatment and prevention, potentially including ultra-long-acting regimens that could extend dosing intervals even further. These developments could revolutionize adherence management and improve quality of life for people living with HIV and those at risk for infection.

### 11.2 Novel Therapeutic Targets

**Capsid Inhibitors:**
Beyond lenacapavir, additional capsid inhibitors are in development, targeting different stages of the viral life cycle. These agents may offer options for individuals with extensive drug resistance or provide components for novel combination regimens.

**Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies:**
Research on broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) continues to advance, with potential applications in both treatment and prevention. These immunologic agents could provide long-acting protection or serve as components of functional cure strategies.

### 11.3 HIV Cure Research

**"Shock and Kill" Strategies:**
Research continues on approaches to reactivate latent HIV reservoirs while simultaneously enhancing immune clearance mechanisms. These strategies aim to achieve sustained remission without ongoing antiretroviral therapy.

**Gene Editing Approaches:**
CRISPR and other gene editing technologies are being investigated for their potential to disable HIV proviral DNA or modify cellular targets to prevent infection or reactivation.

### 11.4 Prevention Innovations

**Multipurpose Prevention Technologies:**
Development continues on products that simultaneously prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancy. These multipurpose technologies could significantly improve user acceptability and public health impact.

**Innovative Delivery Systems:**
Research on novel delivery mechanisms includes vaginal rings, implantable devices, and microneedle patches that could provide discrete, long-acting protection with minimal user intervention.

### 11.5 Artificial Intelligence and Precision Medicine

**Treatment Optimization:**
AI and machine learning applications are being developed to optimize treatment selection, predict treatment outcomes, and personalize therapy based on individual patient characteristics, genetic profiles, and viral factors.

**Drug Resistance Prediction:**
Advanced computational models are being developed to predict the emergence of drug resistance and guide optimal sequencing of antiretroviral regimens.
