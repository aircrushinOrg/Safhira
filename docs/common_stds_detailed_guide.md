# Common Sexually Transmitted Diseases: A Detailed Clinical Guide

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive clinical guide provides evidence-based information on the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The guide covers six major categories of STDs: syphilis, gonorrhea, genital herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, and other common infections including trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and chancroid.

Each STD section includes detailed information on pathogenic organisms, clinical presentations across disease stages, diagnostic methodologies, current treatment protocols, and prevention strategies. The information is based on the most current CDC STI Treatment Guidelines (2021) and WHO recommendations, incorporating recent clinical updates from 2024. Special attention is given to antimicrobial resistance patterns, particularly for gonorrhea, and updated vaccination recommendations for HPV and hepatitis B.

Key findings include the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea, the critical importance of early syphilis detection during pregnancy, the role of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in improving diagnostic accuracy, and the significant public health impact of asymptomatic infections. The guide emphasizes evidence-based approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, serving as a comprehensive resource for healthcare providers, medical students, and public health professionals.

## 1. Introduction

Sexually transmitted diseases represent one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide, affecting millions of individuals annually and contributing to substantial morbidity, healthcare costs, and social burden[1,6]. In 2023, more than 2.4 million cases of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis were reported in the United States alone, with STIs continuing to increase despite available prevention and treatment options[6].

The landscape of STI management has evolved significantly in recent years, with advances in diagnostic technology, updated treatment guidelines to address antimicrobial resistance, and expanded vaccination programs. This comprehensive guide synthesizes the most current evidence-based recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO), incorporating clinical updates through 2024[1,2,6].

The scope of this guide encompasses the most prevalent STIs, including bacterial infections (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid), viral infections (herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B), parasitic infections (trichomoniasis), and fungal infections (candidiasis). Each section provides clinicians with essential information on pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, treatment protocols, and prevention strategies.

Understanding STI epidemiology is crucial for effective clinical practice. STIs disproportionately affect young people aged 15-24 years, with higher prevalence among certain populations including men who have sex with men (MSM), individuals with HIV infection, and those in correctional facilities[6]. Many STIs are asymptomatic, particularly in the early stages, making routine screening essential for disease control and prevention of complications.

## 2. Syphilis

### Pathogen and Transmission

Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacterium that requires direct contact with infected lesions for transmission[2]. The organism is highly infectious during the primary and secondary stages when mucocutaneous lesions are present. T. pallidum is transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex, as well as through vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy.

### Clinical Stages and Symptoms

Syphilis progression occurs in distinct stages, each with characteristic clinical manifestations[2]:

**Primary Syphilis**
Primary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer (chancre) at the site of infection, typically appearing 10-90 days after exposure. However, multiple, atypical, or painful lesions can occur. The chancre is usually indurated, has clean borders, and heals spontaneously within 3-6 weeks even without treatment. Common sites include the genital area, perianal region, and mouth.

**Secondary Syphilis** 
Secondary syphilis develops 4-10 weeks after the primary lesion and represents systemic dissemination of T. pallidum. Manifestations include a characteristic non-pruritic rash that typically involves the palms and soles, mucocutaneous lesions (condyloma lata), lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, and headache. The rash can be macular, papular, or pustular and may involve any part of the body.

**Latent Syphilis**
Latent syphilis is defined by the presence of reactive serologic tests in the absence of clinical manifestations. It is subdivided into early latent (acquired within the preceding year) and late latent syphilis (acquired more than one year ago or of unknown duration). This distinction is crucial for treatment decisions.

**Tertiary Syphilis**
Tertiary syphilis can occur 10-30 years after initial infection and includes cardiovascular syphilis, gummatous syphilis, and neurosyphilis. Cardiovascular manifestations include aortitis and aortic regurgitation. Gummatous lesions are destructive granulomatous lesions that can affect any organ.

**Neurosyphilis**
Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis infection. Early neurologic manifestations include cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, and stroke. Late manifestations include tabes dorsalis and general paresis. Patients may present with altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits[2].

**Ocular and Otosyphilis**
Ocular syphilis can present as uveitis, retinal vasculitis, or optic neuropathy and can occur at any stage. Otosyphilis typically presents with sudden hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo[2].

### Diagnostic Methods

Syphilis diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical findings and laboratory tests[2]:

**Direct Detection Methods**
- Darkfield microscopy of lesion exudate can identify motile T. pallidum spirochetes
- Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can detect T. pallidum DNA from lesions
- Direct fluorescent antibody testing of lesion material

**Serologic Testing**
Serologic diagnosis requires both nontreponemal and treponemal tests:

*Nontreponemal Tests:*
- Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test
- Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test
- These tests are quantitative and used for monitoring treatment response
- False positives can occur with autoimmune conditions, pregnancy, and other infections

*Treponemal Tests:*
- T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) assay
- Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs)
- These tests remain reactive for life in most patients

**Testing Algorithms**
Traditional algorithm: Nontreponemal test followed by confirmatory treponemal test
Reverse algorithm: Initial treponemal screening followed by quantitative nontreponemal test

**Cerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation**
CSF examination is indicated for patients with neurologic or ocular symptoms. CSF-VDRL is highly specific but insensitive. CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein support the diagnosis of neurosyphilis[2].

### Treatment Protocols

Penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis[2]:

**Primary, Secondary, and Early Latent Syphilis**
- Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly in a single dose
- Alternative for nonpregnant patients allergic to penicillin: Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days

**Late Latent Syphilis, Latent Syphilis of Unknown Duration, and Tertiary Syphilis**
- Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly weekly for 3 consecutive weeks
- Alternative for nonpregnant patients: Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 28 days

**Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis**
- Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18-24 million units daily (administered as 3-4 million units intravenously every 4 hours) for 10-14 days

**Pregnancy Considerations**
Penicillin is the only recommended treatment during pregnancy. Penicillin-allergic pregnant women should undergo desensitization and receive penicillin[2].

**Treatment Monitoring**
Patients should have follow-up serologic testing to ensure treatment response. A fourfold decline in nontreponemal titers is expected within 6-12 months for early syphilis and 12-24 months for late syphilis.

## 3. Gonorrhea

### Pathogen and Epidemiology

Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus that infects mucous membranes of the genital tract, rectum, pharynx, and conjunctiva[3]. With approximately 1.6 million new infections annually in the United States, gonorrhea represents the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection[3,7].

### Clinical Presentation

**Men**
Urogenital gonorrhea in men typically presents with urethritis characterized by purulent urethral discharge and dysuria. Symptoms usually develop within 2-7 days of exposure, though some infections may be asymptomatic. Complications can include epididymitis, prostatitis, and rarely, disseminated gonococcal infection.

**Women**
Gonorrhea in women is often asymptomatic or presents with nonspecific symptoms such as increased vaginal discharge, dysuria, intermenstrual bleeding, or pelvic pain. Complications include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain[8].

**Extragenital Infections**
- *Rectal gonorrhea:* Often asymptomatic but may cause anal discharge, pain, or bleeding
- *Pharyngeal gonorrhea:* Usually asymptomatic; may cause sore throat
- *Disseminated gonococcal infection:* Rare complication presenting with arthritis, tenosynovitis, and skin lesions

### Diagnostic Methods

**Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)**
NAATs are the recommended diagnostic method due to superior sensitivity and specificity compared to culture[3]. They can be performed on:
- Urine specimens (first-catch urine preferred for men)
- Urethral swabs (men)
- Endocervical or vaginal swabs (women)
- Rectal and pharyngeal swabs for extragenital testing

**Culture**
Culture remains important for:
- Cases where antimicrobial susceptibility testing is needed
- Suspected treatment failure
- Legal proceedings
- Testing in children (with sexual abuse considerations)

### Treatment Protocols and Antibiotic Resistance

Antimicrobial resistance represents a critical challenge in gonorrhea management. N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to virtually all previously recommended antibiotics[3,7].

**Current Recommended Treatment**
- Ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscularly in a single dose (for persons weighing <150 kg)
- Ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly in a single dose (for persons weighing ≥150 kg)

**Dual Therapy Considerations**
When chlamydial coinfection is not ruled out:
- Add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days (nonpregnant patients)
- Add azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose (pregnant patients)

**Alternative Regimens**
When ceftriaxone is unavailable:
- Gentamicin 240 mg intramuscularly plus azithromycin 2 g orally (single doses)
- Cefixime 800 mg orally (single dose) - for urogenital and rectal infections only

**Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring**
The CDC monitors antibiotic resistance through surveillance programs including the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP)[7]. Healthcare providers should report suspected treatment failures to public health authorities.

### Complications and Prevention

**Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)**
Untreated gonorrhea in women can ascend to cause PID, affecting the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. PID can result in tubal scarring, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility[8].

**Prevention Strategies**
- Consistent condom use during sexual activity
- Regular screening of sexually active individuals at risk
- Partner notification and treatment
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis considerations for high-risk populations

## 4. Genital Herpes

### Viral Types and Pathogenesis

Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), both DNA viruses in the family Herpesviridae[4]. While HSV-2 traditionally caused most genital herpes cases, HSV-1 now accounts for an increasing proportion of genital infections, particularly among young women and men who have sex with men[4].

After primary infection, HSV establishes latency in sensory nerve ganglia and can reactivate periodically, causing recurrent episodes. HSV-2 typically causes more frequent recurrences and subclinical shedding than HSV-1 when causing genital infections[4].

### Clinical Manifestations

**Primary Episode**
First clinical episodes can be severe, with multiple painful vesicles that ulcerate and crust over. Systemic symptoms including fever, headache, malaise, and inguinal lymphadenopathy are common. The illness typically lasts 10-14 days[4].

**Recurrent Episodes**
Recurrent episodes are generally shorter (3-5 days), less severe, and may be preceded by prodromal symptoms such as tingling or burning. Many individuals experience 4-5 recurrences per year, with frequency typically decreasing over time[4].

**Asymptomatic Shedding**
Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be transmitted during periods of asymptomatic viral shedding when no lesions are present. This accounts for a significant proportion of HSV transmission[4].

### Diagnostic Methods

**Virologic Tests**
- *Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs):* Most sensitive method (90-100% sensitivity)
- *Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):* Preferred for CNS infections
- *Viral Culture:* Less sensitive, particularly for recurrent lesions
- All isolates should be typed to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2

**Serologic Tests**
Type-specific serologic assays can distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 antibodies:
- Based on glycoprotein G1 (gG1) for HSV-1 and glycoprotein G2 (gG2) for HSV-2
- Useful for asymptomatic individuals with infected partners
- HSV-2 antibodies indicate genital infection, while HSV-1 antibodies may reflect oral or genital infection[4]

### Treatment and Management

**Antiviral Medications**
Three antiviral drugs are FDA-approved for HSV treatment:
- Acyclovir (oldest, least expensive)
- Valacyclovir (better bioavailability, less frequent dosing)
- Famciclovir (alternative option)

**First Clinical Episode**
All patients with first episodes should receive antiviral therapy[4]:
- Acyclovir 400 mg orally three times daily for 7-10 days
- Valacyclovir 1 g orally twice daily for 7-10 days  
- Famciclovir 250 mg orally three times daily for 7-10 days

**Recurrent Episodes - Episodic Therapy**
Treatment is most effective when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset:
- Acyclovir 800 mg orally twice daily for 5 days
- Valacyclovir 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days
- Famciclovir 1 g orally twice daily for 1 day

**Suppressive Therapy**
Daily antiviral therapy can reduce recurrence frequency by 70-80% and reduce transmission risk[4]:
- Acyclovir 400 mg orally twice daily
- Valacyclovir 500 mg or 1 g orally once daily
- Famciclovir 250 mg orally twice daily

### Long-term Management and Counseling

**Patient Education**
Comprehensive counseling should address:
- Natural history of genital herpes
- Recurrence patterns and triggers
- Transmission risks and prevention strategies
- Impact on relationships and pregnancy
- Treatment options and their limitations[4]

**Prevention of Transmission**
- Abstinence during symptomatic episodes
- Consistent condom use (reduces but doesn't eliminate transmission risk)
- Suppressive antiviral therapy for infected partners
- Discussion of transmission risks with potential partners

**Special Populations**
- *HIV-infected individuals:* May require higher doses or longer treatment duration
- *Pregnant women:* Suppressive therapy may be considered starting at 36 weeks gestation
- *Immunocompromised patients:* Often require extended treatment courses

## 5. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection

### Viral Types and Cancer Relationship

Human papillomavirus comprises over 200 different types, with approximately 40 types infecting the genital tract[9]. HPV types are classified based on their cancer potential:

**High-Risk Types**
Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 73 are associated with cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, and other cancers. HPV types 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers worldwide[9].

**Low-Risk Types**
Types 6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of genital warts but rarely progress to cancer[9].

### Clinical Manifestations

**Cervical Disease**
HPV infection can cause cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which may progress to invasive cervical cancer if left untreated. Most HPV infections are transient, with 90% clearing within two years through immune response[9].

**Genital Warts**
Condylomata acuminata appear as flesh-colored, exophytic growths in the genital and perianal areas. They may be single or multiple, small or large, and can cause physical discomfort or psychological distress.

**Other HPV-Related Cancers**
High-risk HPV types can cause:
- Anal cancer
- Oropharyngeal cancer
- Vulvar and vaginal cancers
- Penile cancer

### Vaccination Programs

**Available Vaccines**
- *9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9):* Protects against types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58
- Highly effective in preventing HPV-related cancers and genital warts when administered before exposure[9]

**Vaccination Recommendations**
- Routine vaccination at ages 11-12 years (can start at age 9)
- Catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those not previously vaccinated
- Shared clinical decision-making for adults ages 27-45 years
- Two-dose schedule for those starting vaccination before age 15
- Three-dose schedule for those starting at age 15 or older[9]

### Screening Methods

**Cervical Cancer Screening**
Current guidelines recommend[9]:
- Ages 21-29 years: Pap test every 3 years
- Ages 30-65 years: Pap test every 3 years, HPV testing every 5 years, or co-testing every 5 years
- Ages >65 years: May discontinue screening if adequate prior screening

**HPV Testing**
- Primary HPV screening can detect high-risk types before cellular changes occur
- More sensitive than Pap testing for detecting clinically significant lesions
- Allows for extended screening intervals

**Management of Abnormal Results**
- Abnormal Pap results require colposcopic evaluation
- HPV-positive results with normal Pap may warrant repeat testing or colposcopy based on age and HPV type

### Prevention Strategies

**Primary Prevention**
- HPV vaccination before sexual activity initiation
- Delayed sexual debut
- Limiting number of sexual partners
- Consistent condom use (provides partial protection)

**Secondary Prevention**
- Regular cervical cancer screening
- Appropriate management of precancerous lesions
- HPV testing for high-risk types

## 6. Chlamydia Infection

### Pathogen and Epidemiology

Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the most frequently reported bacterial infectious disease in the United States, with the highest prevalence among individuals aged ≤24 years[5]. The infection often presents asymptomatically, contributing to its widespread transmission and serious complications.

### Clinical Presentations

**Asymptomatic Infections**
The majority of chlamydial infections are asymptomatic in both men and women, making routine screening essential for detection and prevention of complications[5].

**Symptomatic Urogenital Infections**
- *Men:* Urethritis with mucoid or purulent discharge, dysuria, urethral itching
- *Women:* Mucopurulent cervicitis, increased vaginal discharge, intermenstrual bleeding, dysuria

**Extragenital Infections**
- *Rectal chlamydia:* Often asymptomatic; may cause rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding
- *Oropharyngeal chlamydia:* Typically asymptomatic[5]

### Complications

**Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)**
Untreated chlamydial infection can ascend to cause PID in women, leading to[5,8]:
- Endometritis
- Salpingitis  
- Tubo-ovarian abscess
- Perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome)

**Reproductive Sequelae**
- Tubal factor infertility
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Chronic pelvic pain

**Reactive Arthritis**
Both men and women can develop chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis, characterized by joint inflammation, urethritis, and conjunctivitis[5].

**Neonatal Infections**
Infants born to infected mothers may develop:
- Conjunctivitis (5-12 days after birth)
- Pneumonia (1-3 months of age) with characteristic staccato cough[5]

### Diagnostic Methods

**Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)**
NAATs are the recommended diagnostic method due to superior sensitivity and specificity[5]:
- *Specimen types:* Vaginal swabs (optimal for women), first-void urine, urethral swabs
- *Self-collected specimens:* Vaginal swabs for women, first-catch urine for men
- *Extragenital testing:* Rectal and oropharyngeal swabs using validated NAATs

**Point-of-Care Tests**
Emerging NAAT-based point-of-care tests show promising performance characteristics and may improve treatment initiation[5].

### Treatment Protocols

**Recommended Treatment**
The preferred regimen for uncomplicated chlamydial infection is[5]:
- Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days

This represents a change from previous recommendations due to superior efficacy against rectal chlamydial infections compared to single-dose azithromycin.

**Alternative Treatment**
- Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
- Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days

**Special Populations**

*Pregnancy:*
- Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose (preferred)
- Amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days (alternative)
- Doxycycline is contraindicated during pregnancy[5]

*Neonatal Conjunctivitis:*
- Erythromycin base 50 mg/kg/day orally divided into four doses for 14 days[5]

### Partner Management and Prevention

**Partner Notification**
Sexual partners within 60 days of symptom onset or diagnosis should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated[5].

**Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT)**
EPT may be considered for female partners when standard partner referral is not feasible[5].

**Retesting**
All individuals diagnosed with chlamydia should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment due to high reinfection rates[5].

## 7. Other Common Sexually Transmitted Infections

### Trichomoniasis

**Pathogen and Epidemiology**
Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite causing the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, affecting approximately 2.6 million individuals in the United States[10]. The infection disproportionately affects women, particularly those of African American ethnicity.

**Clinical Presentation**
Approximately 70-85% of infected individuals are asymptomatic. When present, symptoms include[10]:
- *Women:* Frothy, malodorous vaginal discharge; vulvar irritation; dysuria; strawberry cervix
- *Men:* Urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis (less common)

**Diagnostic Methods**
- *Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests:* Most sensitive method
- *Rapid antigen tests:* Point-of-care options available
- *Wet mount microscopy:* Traditional method with limited sensitivity (44-68%)
- *Culture:* Required for antimicrobial susceptibility testing[10]

**Treatment**
- *Women:* Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days (preferred)
- *Men:* Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose
- *Alternative:* Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose[10]

**Drug Resistance**
Metronidazole resistance occurs in 4-10% of cases. The CDC provides consultation for resistant cases and antimicrobial susceptibility testing[10].

### Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

**Pathogen**
Vulvovaginal candidiasis is primarily caused by Candida albicans, with non-albicans species (particularly C. glabrata) associated with complicated infections[11].

**Clinical Presentation**
Symptoms include vulvar pruritus, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, and thick, curdy discharge[11].

**Classification**
- *Uncomplicated VVC:* Sporadic, mild-to-moderate, likely C. albicans in immunocompetent women
- *Complicated VVC:* Recurrent, severe, non-albicans species, or in immunocompromised women[11]

**Treatment**

*Uncomplicated VVC:*
- Topical azoles (1-7 day regimens) or
- Fluconazole 150 mg orally in a single dose[11]

*Recurrent VVC (≥4 episodes per year):*
- Initial therapy: 7-14 days of topical therapy or fluconazole dosing
- Maintenance: Fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months[11]

*Pregnancy:*
- Only topical azole therapies for 7 days are recommended[11]

### Chancroid

**Pathogen and Epidemiology**
Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi and is rare in the United States, typically occurring in sporadic outbreaks[12]. The infection is a risk factor for HIV transmission.

**Clinical Presentation**
Chancroid presents with one or more painful genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy. The ulcers are typically deep and purulent[12].

**Diagnosis**
Definitive diagnosis requires isolation of H. ducreyi on special culture media (sensitivity <80%). Probable diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and exclusion of other causes of genital ulceration[12].

**Treatment**
Recommended regimens include[12]:
- Azithromycin 1 g orally (single dose)
- Ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly (single dose)
- Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days
- Erythromycin 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days

### Molluscum Contagiosum

**Pathogen and Transmission**
Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and can be sexually transmitted in adults, though it commonly affects children through non-sexual contact[13].

**Clinical Presentation**
Lesions appear as small, firm, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication. They can occur anywhere on the body and typically resolve spontaneously within 6 months to 1 year[13].

**Management**
Treatment is usually not necessary for immunocompetent individuals. For genital lesions or in immunocompromised patients, treatment options include cryotherapy, topical imiquimod, or surgical removal[13].

### Hepatitis B

**Pathogen and Sexual Transmission**
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 50-100 times more infectious than HIV and can be transmitted through sexual contact via exposure to infected blood, semen, or vaginal secretions[14].

**Clinical Presentation**
Acute HBV infection may be asymptomatic or present with jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and nausea. Chronic infection can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma[14].

**Prevention**
The hepatitis B vaccine is highly effective and recommended for all adults at risk for sexual transmission, including[14]:
- Sexually active individuals not in monogamous relationships
- Men who have sex with men  
- Individuals with multiple sex partners
- People with other STIs

**Treatment**
Chronic hepatitis B requires specialist management with antiviral medications such as tenofovir or entecavir[14].

## 8. Diagnostic Approaches and Laboratory Testing

### Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)

NAATs represent the gold standard for diagnosing most bacterial STIs due to their superior sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods. Key advantages include:

- Detection of viable and non-viable organisms
- High sensitivity (>90% for most pathogens)
- Ability to test multiple pathogens simultaneously
- Use of non-invasive specimens (urine, self-collected swabs)

### Point-of-Care Testing

Rapid diagnostic tests enable same-visit diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving clinical outcomes by reducing loss to follow-up. Available tests include:
- Rapid syphilis tests with >95% sensitivity and specificity
- GeneXpert platforms for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas
- HSV-2 type-specific rapid tests

### Specimen Collection and Handling

Proper specimen collection is crucial for diagnostic accuracy:
- First-void urine for men (chlamydia and gonorrhea)
- Vaginal swabs optimal for women (self-collected acceptable)
- Specific collection techniques for extragenital sites
- Transport and storage requirements vary by test type

## 9. Antimicrobial Resistance and Treatment Challenges

### Gonococcal Resistance

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to virtually all previously recommended antibiotics, representing a significant public health threat[3,7]:

- Fluoroquinolone resistance: >90% in many areas
- Azithromycin reduced susceptibility: Increasing prevalence
- Cephalosporin resistance: Emerging concern with treatment failures reported globally

### Management Strategies

- Surveillance programs monitor resistance patterns
- Treatment guidelines updated based on resistance data  
- Dual therapy approaches when indicated
- Culture and susceptibility testing for treatment failures
- Development of new therapeutic agents

### Other Resistance Concerns

- Trichomonas vaginalis: 4-10% metronidazole resistance
